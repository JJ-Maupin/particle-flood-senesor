# particle-flood-senesor
This folder is code written by myself Joshua Maupin and a team of 6 individuals to improve upon and update previous code written by Alfred Kalyanapu to work in flood senesors
Primary Authors of this code go to: Ryan Brewer, Alexander Zandstra, Pearson Garner, Aleksander Bass, Jackson Loggins, and Joshua Maupin. 
In addition to the author of the original source code this has been based on: Alfred Kalyanapu. 

Included is particleIO code to be imported directly onto the Boron Microcontroller in a flood sensor, as well as additional weather tracking python code that can
detect changes in weather near current sensors and update the rate at which water levels are detected.
